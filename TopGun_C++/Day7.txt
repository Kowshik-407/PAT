difference between binary and boolean
ASCII values checking  - Total of 255

1.
if print("abc"): print("Hello") --> it works on the concept of boolean : print() doesn't return any value. Hence, 0
op: abc

2.
if 10<20:
    print('1')

if 10<20:
print('1')

if 10<20:
 print('1')

Which results indentation error --> 2

3. 
if 3 and 0 or 4:
 print('1')
else:
 print('0')

Op: 1 --> Evaluation of if statement always from left to right. (and) & (or) operation always checks non-zero or zero value.

4. 
l=[1,2,3,4]
print(all(l)) and try any and have list 0 returns True and False



5. 
if 1 in '123':
    print(1)
if 1 in 123:
    print(2)
op: TypeError - argument of type 'int' is not iterable for 2nd if stmt
    TypeError - requires string, not int for 1st if stmt

6. 
Why string is a default datatype in python? ::> string is a char array, and ends with null char
 In python there is no character data type, a character is a string of length one.

Which datastructure is default ds in python? ::> Python's tuples are a straightforward data structure for grouping arbitrary objects. Tuples are immutableâ€”they can't be modified once they've been created. Performance-wise, tuples take up slightly less memory than lists in CPython, and they're also faster to construct.

How many data structures in python? ::> Python has four basic inbuilt data structures namely Lists, Dictionary, Tuple and Set. These almost cover 80% of the our real world data structures.

a,b=4,2
switch={
1:a+b,
2.a-b
}
switch.get(2) --> ans::> 2
Switch case in python ::> It is meant by dictionary hence, we can have any data type
whereas, in c: we can have only int and char as a keyvalue

Note: There is a null-termination in python.

7. 
v = 10
for i in range(10):
    v += 1
else:
    v += 1
print(v)
op: v = 21 ::> because, for every loop termination else condition is True because, i will be happen 11 and for loop will be taken as false, therefore, it satisfies else stmt. There will be no syntax error of using else without if stmt.
Note: after using the continue stmt, we cannot have any stmt to be taken.

Arrays and strings are datastructures, but not datatypes .

Basic programs to be prepared - Number systems, datastructures

What are the type of statements - 
int a=5; // It is a definition of a variable. (Always to be valued as reverse. 5 is valued to the variable a and the type of int)
int a; // not declaration. It is static variable
a=5;   // assignment or initialization

Variable declaration syntax - 
storageclass typeclassifier typemodifier datatype variable;

Arrays - A collection of data with similar datatype, and accesing of sequential memory location.
Recursion - A function calls itself, and terminates the function using base case.

In arrays - A2x3 --> A can be said as script not as array name |||| 2X3 can be said as subscript not as rows and columns
A[2][3] --> 2 and 3 are called as dimensions not as rows and cols 
	--> 2 represents the number of 1D dimensions and 3 represents represents the number of elements in 1D dimension
A[][3]  --> It is valid
A[2][]  --> It is invalid

sets - ordered indices 
dictionary - unordered indices
